                  The web is a place for everybody, but living up to that spirit
                  takes work. SADL always gives its code meaning, uses
                  semantics, and adds accessibility hooks, so that nobody gets
                  left behind.

                  The web should last. A website that provides valuable
                  information shouldnâ€™t ever stop; that means writing code that
                  can be understood and maintained, and making it easy to run
                  that code in the real world, for a very long time.

                <Text>
                  The web should be joyful, without getting in your way. That
                  means using good design, appropriate animation, and a little
                  bit of whimsy - but it also means showing restraint. Design is
                  how it works; additional flourish should aid the user in
                  understanding the content, and never distract.

                  The best web is the one we have. A pursuit of perfection is
                  noble, but futile. Sometimes, scope needs to be cut - but as
                  long as the core principles remain, a product can still be
                  good. Never cut corners, but always be prepared to simplify.

              Our mission is to make the web a more joyful place - by providing
              easy access to reliable information, without obstacles.

            <Text>
              That means putting accessibility at the forefront, because
              everybody should be on a level playing field. It means developing
              with meaning, always asking why, and providing the answers in a
              predictable way. It means making the lives of other developers
              easier, by providing clear documentation and good, reliable open
              source projects.
